# Scanner Issues
    1) Deal with mismatched String/Text quotes 
// TODO: How to only have one this pointer per object? :?

# Modifier Checker Issues
    1) A METHOD CAN BE FINAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    2) Error out when there's a double final, pure, or recurs (needed for methods)

# Current Command-Line Options
    1) --start-vm: Start the C Minor virtual machine
    2) --print-tokens: Print out generated tokens during parsing
    3) --print-tree: Print out AST after parsing is complete

    --- NEW ---
    4) --show-help: Print out suggestions?


# Possible Warnings
    1) Value may uninitialized at localdecl -- TypeChecking
    2) Infinite loop 

# GUI
    1) Design components on paper
    2) Class Object at least, and multiple instances of the class 
    3) Look up how to design GUIs 
    4) 3 pages at least should be enough
    5) Front End - GUI, Back End - Compiler, Middle End - API to connect the two
    6) Don't think of it as a GUI that interfaces with C Minor, but a GUI BY ITSELF
    7) Think of the GUI Canvas as a VM 


# GUI MORE 
    1) Create a separate window for instances?
    2) Hide the CLI initially
    3) Debug the trace of the execution
    4) Right click -> Refact -> change signature for add method/field
    5) Main file will create small window/queue

# Stuff To Remember
    1) List is dynamic

# 3/24
    1) Solve the diamond problem :)
        - First class that is inherited, method will come from there 

# 4/ 7
    1) Warnings for using the wrong for loops

# 4/14
    1) Create a GUI with options (function, etc.)   
    1) Cretate a function, on canvas draw a box, see a menu to interest with function
