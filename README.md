C Minor is a pedagogical language created by Dr. Minor and Dr. Cisneros at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

C Minor is a C-based language that is statically scoped and typed. The goal of this language is to provide first
year computer science students with an introductory language to help learn fundamental imperative programming
concepts. This includes variables, typing, conditional and iterative statements, functions, object-oriented
programming, and recursion.

Through this language, we hope to teach students about how to program and help them develop good programming 
habits for their professional careers.
